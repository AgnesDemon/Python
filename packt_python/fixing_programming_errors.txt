Errors are bugs in programs that make the program to function incorrectly.
There are two types of errors in Python: Syntax Errors and Exceptions
The terminal will usually show you the location of the error.
The terminal can also explain what kind of error is in the code.


SYNTAX ERRORS:
Example: int 9
The error: parenthesis are missing
How to fix it: add parenthesis to the sides of 9 - int(9)

Example: a = [1,2,3)
The error: both ends need to have brackets, not parenthesis.
            It also cannot have two different ends, such as start bracket and end parenthesis
How to fix it: change the end parenthesis to an end bracket - a = [1,2,3]

EXCEPTIONS:
Example:
    a = 1
    b = "2"
    print(int(2.5)
    print(a + b)
Error 1:
    The error will show itself as a syntax error, which can be confusing.
    This is because the previous line is missing a parenthesis.
    The error continues on into the next line.
How to fix it: add another parenthesis - print(int(2.5))

Error 2:
    The second error has to do with the variables a and b.
    a has an integer while b has a string.
    The print statement in line 4 wants to add the integer and string together, but it won't work.
How to fix it: add a float statement to variable b to change it into an integer:
    print(a + float(b))
    #Note: this will print 3.00 in the terminal
Or: add a string statement to the variable a:
    print(str(a) + b)
    #Note: this will print 12 in the terminal because it is not actually adding the values together
These are known as type errors.

Example:
    a = 3
    b = 4
    print(c)
The error: c is not defined.
This is also known as a name error.
How to fix it: add a new variable, c, and give it a value

Example:
    c = 5
    print(c/0)
The error: you cannot divide anything by zero. This is a zero division error.
How to fix it: don't divide anything by zero.
