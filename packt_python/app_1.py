#APP 1: WEB MAPPING WITH PYTHON: INTERACTIVE MAPPING OF POPULATION AND VOLCANOES
#Latitude: goes from -90 to 90
#Longitude: goes from -180 to 180
#To run folium in the Python interactive shell, be sure to import it first
#'map = folium.Map(location[80, -100])' sets coordinates on a map
#Be sure to save this with 'map.save(Map1.html)'
#You can override this with the same code but different coordinates
#You can use Google Maps to find coordinates of specific places
#You can also zoom in the map with 'map = folium.Map(location[80, -100], zoom_start=6)'
#Save with 'map.save(Map1.html)' and open the map again
#You can also just reload the web page instead of opening a new one
#Either way, you should get a zoomed in map
