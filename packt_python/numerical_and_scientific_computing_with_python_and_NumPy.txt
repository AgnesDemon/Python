Programs use numbers to store images
Images can be represented as lists
NumPy is a library that provides a multi-dimensional array object
NumPy should already be installed with pandas
Use pip to install NumPy if you don't have NumPy

One-dimensional array: n=numpy.arange(27)
Prints: 'array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... 25, 26])'

Two-dimensional array: n.reshape(3, 9)
Prints: 'array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
                [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],
                [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]])'

Three-dimensional array: n.reshape(3, 3, 3)
Prints: 'array([[[0, 1, 2],
                [3, 4, 5],
                [6, 7, 8]],
                
                [[9, 10, 11],
                [12, 13, 14],
                [15, 16, 17]],
                
                [[18, 19, 20],
                [21, 22, 23],
                [24, 25, 26]]])'

NumPy arrays and Python lists are similar, but not the same

To import an image, type 'import cv2'
In next line, type im_g=cv2.inread("image.png,0)
The inread function requires two arguments: the image name and either 0 or 1.
0 means that you want to read the image in grayscale
1 means that you want to read the image in BGR (Blue, Green, Red)
In the next line, type 'im_g' to run it
It should give you a 2D NumPy array that has the same dimensions as your image
Now, say you were to type 'im_g=cv2(image.png,1)'
In the next line, type 'im_g' to run it
Instead of a 2D array, you would get a 3D array
Each box of numbers have the same dimensions as the image
However, each box represents a different color and their intensity
The first box is for blue and blue's intensity
The second box is for green and green's intensity
The third and final box is for red and red's intensity
As an example, say you have a 3x5 pixel image with different tones of gray
You have already printed out a 3D/BGR array
The first pixel would have a blue intensity of 187, a green intensity of 198, and a red intensity of 209

To create a copy of the pixel image:
Type 'cv2.imwrite("newimage.png", im_g)'
If you run this, and your output it True, then the copy should have been created
