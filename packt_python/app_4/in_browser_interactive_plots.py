#Demo
#This is from the Justpy website tutorial on how to make a webpage
#Make sure when creating a webpage, there is a file in the same directory called "justpy.env"
#If there is no such file, the code will not work
#This demo creates a webpage, and in this webpage, there is a bar that says "Hello! Click me"
#If you click the bar, it will show how many times you have clicked on it in the bar itself, switching from the first phrase to "I've been clicked x times"
