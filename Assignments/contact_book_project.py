        #What will the edit screen look like, maybe ask them what they want to edit
    #Display Contact
        #Shows all contacts
            #Allow user to pick a user id to show a specific contact
    #Remove contact
        #Probably should confirm they really want to do this
        #How do we decide who to remove

    #Last name
    #Address
    #City
    #State
